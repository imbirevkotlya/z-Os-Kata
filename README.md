# z-Os-Kata

## Katas repository for mainframe trainings from scratch

### Prerequisities
- Terminal emulator 3270 (I reccommend, [ZOC](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/tn3270-terminal-emulation.html))

- Connection to the mainframe (try use Hercules instead, it is compatible and okay, or maybe use IBM licences to do it)

- General understanding, what the mainframe is
